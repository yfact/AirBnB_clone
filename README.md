#AirBnB project

# Description: This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integrationâ€¦

#Command interpreter
A command interpreter, often referred to as a shell or command-line interface (CLI), is a program that allows users to interact with a computer's operating system using text-based commands. It provides a way to communicate with the operating system and execute various tasks, such as managing files, running programs, and configuring system settings.

#How to Start the Command Interpreter:
Operating System Default Shell: Most operating systems come with a default shell pre-installed. On Unix-like systems (such as Linux or macOS), common default shells include Bash (Bourne Again Shell) and Zsh (Z Shell). On Windows, the default shell is typically Command Prompt (cmd.exe) or PowerShell.

Terminal Emulator: To start a command interpreter, you usually open a terminal emulator program, such as Terminal on macOS or Linux, or Command Prompt or PowerShell on Windows.

#How to Use the Command Interpreter:
Once you've started the command interpreter, you'll see a command prompt where you can type commands. Here are some common actions you can perform:

*Navigating the File System:

-cd: Change directory.
-ls (Unix-like) or dir (Windows): List files and directories in the current directory.
-pwd (Unix-like) or cd (Windows): Show the current working directory.

*Manipulating Files and Directories:

-mkdir: Create a new directory.
-touch (Unix-like) or New-Item (PowerShell): Create a new file.
-cp (Unix-like) or Copy-Item (PowerShell): Copy files or directories.
-mv (Unix-like) or Move-Item (PowerShell): Move or rename files or directories.
-rm (Unix-like) or Remove-Item (PowerShell): Remove files or directories.

#Running Programs:

Simply type the name of the program you want to run, followed by any required arguments. For example, python script.py to run a Python script.
Managing Processes:

-ps (Unix-like) or Get-Process (PowerShell): List running processes.
-kill (Unix-like) or Stop-Process (PowerShell): Terminate a running process.

*Redirection and Pipelines:

'>' and >> (Unix-like) or > and Out-File (PowerShell): Redirect output to a file.
-'|' (pipe): Pass the output of one command as input to another command.

Examples:

1.Changing directory:
cd Documents

2.Listing files and directories:
ls

3.Creating a new directory:
mkdir my_folder

4.Running a Python script:
python my_script.py
